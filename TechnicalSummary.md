Built with p5.js, the project demonstrates complex particle interactions through force dynamics, cluster formation, and visual representation techniques.

### 1.1 Core Objectives

1. Create a realistic particle simulation with emergent clustering behavior
2. Implement sophisticated force interactions (attraction, repulsion, stickiness)
3. Develop intelligent cluster detection and tracking mechanisms
4. Provide intuitive visual feedback about cluster formation and interactions
5. Implement advanced rendering techniques for cluster visualization
6. Optimize performance for handling large numbers of particles

## 2. Technical Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### 2.1 Core Modules

1. **Particle System**: Handles individual particle properties and behaviors
2. **Force System**: Manages force calculations and interactions between particles
3. **Renderer**: Visualizes particles and their clustering behaviors
4. **Simulation Manager**: Coordinates the overall simulation flow
5. **UI System**: Provides user interface for parameter adjustments

### 2.2 Key Files and Their Purposes

- `js/particle.js`: Defines the Particle class with position, velocity, mass, and clustering properties
- `js/particleFactory.js`: Implements the ParticleFactory class for centralized particle creation and configuration
- `js/force.js`: Implements the ForceSystem class for calculating forces and detecting clusters
- `js/render.js`: Contains the Renderer class for visualizing particles and clusters
- `js/simulation.js`: Manages the overall simulation state and lifecycle
- `js/main.js`: Entry point that initializes the simulation
- `js/ui.js`: Handles user interface elements and interactions

## 3. Core Algorithms and Mechanisms

### 3.1 Force Calculation System

The force system (`ForceSystem` class) is the heart of the simulation, implementing:

1. **Attraction Forces**: Particles attract each other at distances greater than the threshold
   ```javascript
   forceMagnitude = config.attractionCoefficient * (p1.mass * p2.mass) / (distance * distance);
   ```

2. **Sticky Forces**: Additional attractive forces at intermediate distances
   ```javascript
   const stickyForceMagnitude = config.stickyForceCoefficient * 
       (p1.mass * p2.mass) / Math.pow(distance, config.stickyForcePower);
   ```

3. **Repulsion Forces**: Particles repel when too close and after a delay period
   - Between different clusters:
     ```javascript
     forceMagnitude = -config.repulsionCoefficient * (p1.mass * p2.mass) / (distance * distance);
     ```
   - Within the same cluster (radial repulsion):
     ```javascript
     // Calculate radial directions from cluster center
     const p1Direction = p5.Vector.sub(p1.position, clusterCenter).normalize();
     const p2Direction = p5.Vector.sub(p2.position, clusterCenter).normalize();
     
     // Apply outward radial forces
     const radialForceMagnitude = config.repulsionCoefficient * 0.5 * 
         (p1.mass * p2.mass) / (distance * distance);
     ```

### 3.2 Cluster Detection Algorithm

The simulation uses a disjoint-set (union-find) data structure to efficiently identify distinct clusters:

1. Each particle starts in its own set
2. Particles within proximity threshold are unioned into the same set
3. After processing all connections, distinct clusters are identified
4. Cluster properties (size, center) are calculated and tracked

```javascript
// Union function to merge sets
const union = (x, y) => {
    parent[find(x)] = find(y);
};

// Process all connections to build the disjoint sets
for (const connection of this.currentClusters) {
    const [id1, id2] = connection.split('-').map(id => parseInt(id));
    union(id1, id2);
}
```

### 3.3 Cluster-wide Repulsion Propagation

A key mechanism ensures that when any particle in a cluster should repulse, the entire cluster repulses:

1. Track cluster repulsion states in a map
2. Check if any particle in a cluster has `shouldRepulse = true`
3. If so, set all particles in that cluster to repulse
4. Apply radial forces from cluster center to create outward expansion

```javascript
// For each cluster, check if any particle has shouldRepulse = true
for (const [clusterIndex, particleIds] of clusterParticles.entries()) {
    let anyParticleShouldRepulse = false;
    
    // Check if any particle in the cluster should repulse
    for (const id of particleIds) {
        if (id >= 0 && id < particles.length && particles[id].shouldRepulse === true) {
            anyParticleShouldRepulse = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Store the cluster's repulsion state
    this.clusterRepulsionStates.set(clusterIndex, anyParticleShouldRepulse);
}
```

### 3.4 Visualization Techniques

The renderer implements sophisticated visual techniques:

1. **Cluster History Visualization**: Fill color based on how many times a particle has been in clusters
   ```javascript
   // Map 0-100 to 240-0 (blue to red)
   mainHue = map(particle.clusterCount, 0, maxClusterCount, 240, 0);
   ```

2. **Cluster Size Visualization**: Outer glow color based on current cluster size
   ```javascript
   // Small clusters (2-20% of max): blue to cyan (240-180)
   // Medium clusters (20-50% of max): cyan to yellow (180-60)
   // Large clusters (50-100% of max): yellow to red (60-0)
   ```

3. **Glow Effect**: Visual indicator for particles in clusters
   ```javascript
   // Draw outer glow effect
   noStroke();
   fill(ringHue, 85, 95, 30);
   circle(particle.position.x, particle.position.y, baseSize + (glowPixels * 2));
   ```

## 5. Recent Improvements

### 5.1 Cluster-wide Repulsion Mechanism

Previously, repulsion was only applied between individual particle pairs, not propagated across entire clusters. This was fixed by:

1. Adding cluster repulsion state tracking
2. Implementing the `propagateRepulsionInClusters` method
3. Ensuring repulsion state is propagated before applying forces

### 5.2 Radial Force Implementation

To ensure entire clusters expand outward during repulsion:

1. Added cluster center tracking
2. Implemented radial force calculation from cluster centers
3. Applied outward forces to all particles in repulsing clusters

### 5.3 Rendering Improvements

1. Removed outer ring, keeping only the glow effect
2. Implemented fixed pixel sizing for glow
3. Enhanced color mapping for cluster sizes to scale with particle count

### 5.4 Repulsion Mechanism Improvements (March 2025)

Fixed an issue where repulsive forces were only being applied to two particles in a cluster, instead of propagating to all particles. The key changes were:

1. **Force Calculation Timing**: Modified the `applyForces` method in `ForceSystem` class to delay cluster status updates until after all forces have been applied
   ```javascript
   // Previous approach (problematic):
   // Reset cluster status at the beginning of force calculation
   if (typeof particles[i].setInCluster === 'function') {
       particles[i].setInCluster(false);
   }
   
   // New approach:
   // First pass: Calculate and apply all forces without resetting cluster states
   // Second pass: Update cluster states after all forces have been applied
   ```

2. **Particle State Management**: Enhanced the `setInCluster` method in `Particle` class to preserve repulsion state when a particle remains in a cluster
   ```javascript
   // Added state tracking variables
   this.wasInCluster = false;
   this.wasRepulsing = false;
   
   // Modified setInCluster to preserve repulsion state
   setInCluster(status) {
       // Store previous state before making changes
       this.wasInCluster = this.inCluster;
       this.wasRepulsing = this.shouldRepulse;
       
       // Only reset repulsion state when first joining a cluster
       if (status && !this.inCluster) {
           this.inCluster = true;
           this.shouldRepulse = false;
           this.repulsionTimer = 0;
       } else if (status && this.inCluster) {
           // Preserve repulsion state when already in a cluster
           this.inCluster = true;
       } else {
           this.inCluster = false;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Repulsion State Preservation**: Ensured that `shouldRepulse` is not automatically reset when a particle remains in a cluster, allowing repulsion to propagate through the entire cluster consistently

These changes ensure that when particles in a cluster should repulse, the repulsion is applied uniformly to all particles in that cluster, not just a pair of particles.

### 5.5 Factory Pattern Implementation (March 2025)

Implemented a dedicated particle factory pattern to improve code organization and maintainability:

1. **Centralized Particle Creation**: Created a new `ParticleFactory` class in `js/particleFactory.js` that handles all particle instantiation:
   ```javascript
   class ParticleFactory {
       constructor(config) {
           this.config = config;
           this.particleCount = 0; // Counter for generating unique IDs
       }
       
       createRandomParticle() {
           const x = random(this.config.current.canvasWidth);
           const y = random(this.config.current.canvasHeight);
           const mass = this.config.current.initialMass;
           
           const particle = new Particle(x, y, mass);
           particle.id = this.particleCount++;
           return particle;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Particle Management**:
   - Consistent ID generation and tracking
   - Support for different particle creation strategies
   - Centralized configuration management

3. **Improved Simulation Integration**:
   - Modified `SimulationManager` to use the factory pattern
   - Simplified particle initialization process
   - Better separation of concerns between creation and management

These changes provide a foundation for future extensions such as different particle types or behaviors.

### 5.6 Visualization and UI Improvements (March 2025)

Enhanced the visualization and user interface to improve user experience and visual clarity:

1. **Constant Line Thickness**: Modified the `renderForceVectors` method in the `Renderer` class to use a constant line thickness for connections between particles
   ```javascript
   // Previous approach (variable thickness):
   const weight = map(clusterSize, 2, 20, 0.5, 1.5);
   
   // New approach (constant thickness):
   const weight = 1; // Set a constant line thickness
   ```

2. **Reduced Color Brightness**: Adjusted HSV values for particle fill and glow effects to reduce brightness and improve visual clarity
   ```javascript
   // Previous approach (brighter colors):
   fill(mainHue, 80, 90);
   fill(ringHue, 85, 95, 30);
   
   // New approach (softer colors):
   fill(mainHue, 60, 70);
   fill(ringHue, 70, 80, 30);
   ```

3. **Improved Rendering Order**: Modified the rendering order to ensure connecting lines are visible on top of particles
   ```javascript
   // Previous approach (connections hidden behind particles):
   // Draw connections first, then particles
   
   // New approach (connections visible on top):
   // Draw particles first, then connections
   ```

4. **One-Click Configurations**: Added "Default Settings" and "Try Me" buttons to the UI for quick configuration
   ```javascript
   // Default Settings button
   const defaultBtn = createButton('Default Settings');
   defaultBtn.mousePressed(() => {
       this.resetToDefaultSettings();
       this.simulation.reset();
   });
   
   // Try Me button
   const tryMeBtn = createButton('Try Me');
   tryMeBtn.mousePressed(() => {
       this.setToTryMeSettings();
       this.simulation.reset();
       this.simulation.start();
   });
   ```

5. **Preset Configurations**: Implemented "Try Me" configurations with optimized parameters for interesting clustering behavior

   **Try Me Settings 1**: Optimized for large-scale circular cluster formation
   ```javascript
   const tryMeSettings = {
       particleCount: 400,
       initialMass: 5,
       maxSpeed: 5,
       dampeningCoefficient: 0.03,
       thresholdDistance: 60,
       attractionCoefficient: 0.03,
       repulsionCoefficient: 1,
       stickyForceCoefficient: 1.21,
       repulsionDelay: 120,
       delayIncrease: 30,
       maxRepulsionDelay: 300,
       minMass: 2,
       maxMass: 20,
       massGainRate: 0.003,
       massLossRate: 0.1
   };
   ```
   
   **Try Me Settings 2**: Optimized for medium-sized clusters with higher attraction
   ```javascript
   const tryMeSettings2 = {
       particleCount: 250,
       initialMass: 5,
       maxSpeed: 5,
       dampeningCoefficient: 0.03,
       thresholdDistance: 40,
       attractionCoefficient: 0.54,
       repulsionCoefficient: 0.22,
       stickyForceCoefficient: 1.21,
       repulsionDelay: 120,
       delayIncrease: 30,
       maxRepulsionDelay: 300,
       minMass: 2,
       maxMass: 20,
       massGainRate: 0.001,
       massLossRate: 0.1
   };
   ```

These improvements enhance the visual experience and make the simulation more accessible to users by providing easy access to optimized configurations.
