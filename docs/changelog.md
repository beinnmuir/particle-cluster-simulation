# Changelog and Recent Improvements

## UI Code Refactoring (March 2025)

The UI code has been refactored using a functional separation approach to improve organization, maintainability, and readability while preserving the ability to open the index.html file directly without a server:

1. **Modular File Structure**: Separated the monolithic `ui.js` into multiple focused files:
   - `ui-core.js`: Main UIController class definition and initialization
   - `ui-controls.js`: Control creation methods for simulation, particles, forces, etc.
   - `ui-morphology.js`: Morphology-specific functions for button styles and visibility
   - `ui-presets.js`: Preset settings functions (default, Try Me settings)
   - `ui-stats.js`: Statistics display creation and update methods
   - `ui-components.js`: Reusable UI component creation methods (sliders, etc.)

2. **Prototype-Based Extension**: Used JavaScript's prototype inheritance to extend the UIController class:
   ```javascript
   // Example from ui-controls.js
   UIController.prototype.createParticleControls = function(container) {
       // Implementation
   };
   ```

3. **Script Loading Order**: Updated index.html to load the UI modules in the correct order:
   ```html
   <!-- UI Modules (Replacing ui.js) -->
   <script src="js/ui-core.js"></script>
   <script src="js/ui-components.js"></script>
   <script src="js/ui-controls.js"></script>
   <script src="js/ui-morphology.js"></script>
   <script src="js/ui-presets.js"></script>
   <script src="js/ui-stats.js"></script>
   ```

4. **Benefits of the Refactoring**:
   - Improved code organization with clear separation of concerns
   - Enhanced maintainability with smaller, focused files
   - Better readability with logical grouping of related functions
   - Preserved direct file access capability without requiring a server
   - No build step required, maintaining simplicity

5. **Original Code Preservation**: The original monolithic implementation has been archived for reference:
   - Original file: `js/ui.js` moved to `js/archive/ui.js`
   - This preserves the original implementation for future reference while keeping the active codebase clean

## Repulsion Mechanism Improvements (March 2025)

Fixed an issue where repulsive forces were only being applied to two particles in a cluster, instead of propagating to all particles. The key changes were:

1. **Force Calculation Timing**: Modified the `applyForces` method in `ForceSystem` class to delay cluster status updates until after all forces have been applied
2. **Particle State Management**: Enhanced the `setInCluster` method in `Particle` class to preserve repulsion state when a particle remains in a cluster
3. **Repulsion State Preservation**: Ensured that `shouldRepulse` is not automatically reset when a particle remains in a cluster

## Factory Pattern Implementation (March 2025)

Implemented a dedicated particle factory pattern to improve code organization and maintainability:

1. **Centralized Particle Creation**: Created a new `ParticleFactory` class in `js/particleFactory.js` that handles all particle instantiation
2. **Enhanced Particle Management**: Added consistent ID generation and tracking
3. **Improved Simulation Integration**: Modified `SimulationManager` to use the factory pattern

## Visualization and UI Improvements (March 2025)

Enhanced the visualization and user interface to improve user experience and visual clarity:

1. **Constant Line Thickness**: Modified the `renderForceVectors` method in the `Renderer` class to use a constant line thickness
2. **Reduced Color Brightness**: Adjusted HSV values for particle fill and glow effects to reduce brightness and improve visual clarity
3. **Improved Rendering Order**: Modified the rendering order to ensure connecting lines are visible on top of particles
4. **One-Click Configurations**: Added "Default Settings" and "Try Me" buttons to the UI for quick configuration
5. **Preset Configurations**: Implemented "Try Me" configurations with optimized parameters for interesting clustering behavior

## Cluster-wide Repulsion Mechanism (Earlier)

Previously, repulsion was only applied between individual particle pairs, not propagated across entire clusters. This was fixed by:

1. Adding cluster repulsion state tracking
2. Implementing the `propagateRepulsionInClusters` method
3. Ensuring repulsion state is propagated before applying forces

## Radial Force Implementation (Earlier)

To ensure entire clusters expand outward during repulsion:

1. Added cluster center tracking
2. Implemented radial force calculation from cluster centers
3. Applied outward forces to all particles in repulsing clusters

## Rendering Improvements (Earlier)

1. Removed outer ring, keeping only the glow effect
2. Implemented fixed pixel sizing for glow
3. Enhanced color mapping for cluster sizes to scale with particle count

## Rod Particle Implementation (March 2025)

Implemented rotational physics for rod-shaped particles to enable more complex and realistic interactions:

1. **RodParticle Class**: Extended the base Particle class with rod-specific properties and behaviors
2. **Moment of Inertia Calculation**: Implemented physics-based moment of inertia calculation for rods
3. **Torque and Force Application**: Added methods to calculate and apply torque when forces are applied off-center
4. **Rotational Dampening**: Implemented consistent dampening for both linear and rotational motion
5. **Selective Interaction Point Model**: Implemented a three-point model that selects the closest point for force interactions
6. **Visual Representation**: Enhanced the display method to render rods with proper orientation

## Force System Integration for Rod Particles (March 2025)

Modified the ForceSystem class to properly handle interactions involving rod particles:

1. **Interaction Point Detection**: Enhanced the force calculation to use the appropriate interaction points
2. **Force Application at Interaction Points**: Modified force application to use the `applyForceAtPoint` method for rod particles
3. **Cluster Repulsion Handling**: Updated the cluster repulsion mechanism to work with rod particles

## UI and Rendering Improvements (March 2025)

Enhanced the user interface and rendering system to improve usability and fix issues with circular particle rendering:

1. **UI Control Improvements**: Replaced dropdown menus with buttons for more reliable particle type selection
2. **Button State Visualization**: Added visual feedback for selected particle type
3. **Conditional UI Controls**: Implemented context-aware controls that only display when relevant
4. **Start/Pause Button Fix**: Corrected the start/pause button state when changing particle types
5. **Particle Type Detection**: Enhanced the particle type detection in the renderer for more reliable identification
6. **Debug Logging**: Added extensive debug logging throughout the simulation and rendering processes
7. **Default Configuration**: Changed the default particle type in the configuration from 'rod' to 'circular'
