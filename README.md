# Particle Clustering Simulation

An interactive simulation where particles attract each other to form clusters, with forces that reverse to repulsion when clusters reach a threshold size. Particles gain mass when clustered and lose mass when isolated, with their clustering history reflected in their color.

## Features

- Dynamic particle behavior with attraction and repulsion forces
- Mass evolution based on clustering
- Visual representation of mass (size) and clustering history (color)
- Interactive UI for parameter tuning
- Modular architecture for easy extension

## Technology

Built with p5.js for rendering and interaction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Use the UI controls to adjust simulation parameters

## Future Enhancements

- Smooth transition functions for force behavior
- Attribute-based interactions (affinity)
- Performance optimizations with spatial partitioning
- 3D simulation capabilities
